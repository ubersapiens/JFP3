    <p><span id="focus">Street workouts</span> have become the epicenter of a revolution combininig calisthenics, prison workouts and bodyweight control. While at <a href="http://www.generalassemb.ly"><span id="focus">General Assembly London</span></a> I decided to create a platform for this movement combining routines, forum and most importantly, an interactive Google Maps made for <id="focus">street athletes</span>. The project was brought to life with a <span id="focus">Ruby on Rails + Bootstrap + REST API</span> stack.</p>

    <p>After Urban Monkey I wanted to target another crowd, with another present-day problem. Why not <span id="focus">developers</span>? I decided to use the same stack, different database, <span id="focus">MongoDB</span>, and to focus on incorporating a cutting edge API: <span id="focus">Stripe Payments</span>. The finished product is a user-friendly portfolio builder for devs and creatives combined with a <span id="focus">patronage/sponsoring</span> platform. The result: <span id="focus">Hacker Farm</span>.</p>
