  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a craftsman living in Paris with a passion for technology and health.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like to live by a short credo: Life needs change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keeping in mind those three words, I have drafted contracts, surfed 2 meter waves, advised private banking clients, sketched random people, sold real estate, lived in 3 continents, wrote a book, hacked ADHD, performed 32 pullups, built web applications, ran two companies, cycled 2000km and cooked delicious seafood risotto.
  </p>
  <p>
    So who am I? That is for you to find out.
  </p>
  <p> 
    Welcome aboard!
