  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    Hyper boy. Lots of ideas. Some of them to impact a person, others to change the world. Engaged by creative motivation. Hacking the human body or bringing dinosaurs back to life. Up for any challenge. Wants to live in a tree house. Won’t take NO for an answer.

    Took a suit and tie approach for a few years to lay a base, to leave the nest. Decided to reach for the skies.

    Turned of age, traveled around and after a nomadic existence, started this blog as a journal to explore the ‘creative side’…that one corner of our mind capable of creating space rockets, online virtual worlds and hand-held devices that change the world with one click.
