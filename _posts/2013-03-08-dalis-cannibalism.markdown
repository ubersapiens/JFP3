It’s difficult to recognise genius in a world where it is abundant. More than ever, the world is packed with levels of mastery in skills that keep getting multiplying themselves in numbers and qualities. Art is one of those where the opposite has occurred, at least in my opinion. As amazing as it may be, how can you call Goya’s Saturn eating his child and Hirst’s shark in a tank, art. The Pollocks, the Hirsts and the Warhols never impressed me and due to that I have always categorized modern art as plain trash.

However, just like any opinion and thought can be manipulated, so could my taste for 20th/21st Century art. Salvador Dali has become my favorite artist of all time after visiting his exposition at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Not only was I dazzled by a never-before seen array of colors displayed in canvases or sculptures throughout the five rooms of the show, but at the same time, I had never seen that level of complexity and analyses in a single person’s artistic expression.

I went from masterpiece to masterpiece, sometimes staying as much as 15 minutes staring at the same one trying to decipher what else could he be thinking and what I could be missing. From men eating themselves in a deformed cannibalistic ambience to the powers of temptation crushing down on a single man’s will, everything was exceptional.

There was one particular piece that left me riddled as to what was Dali trying to convey through his Escher-like puzzles and diverted story lines of previous creations. Macbeth.
