As I tried to distract myself and give my brain a breather from constant iteration, I had a flashback of the same moment happening all over again, except 13 years ago. Back in school , teenage years, internet exploding, rebel curiosity. I could say if I combined all of those four defining factors and put them into one package it would be called Ultima Online: The Second Age.

While many might question the last sentence, read it again. Every other experience around this time had immense impact in my life, but nothing like the hours I would spend carrying a sword on one hand, a wand in the other one and my eyes on winning a battle of faction guilds in the middle of a virtual medieval fantasy scenario. UO was the first and strongest of its kind. Hipsters might disagree and Atari lovers might grunt but World of Warcraft and Dungeons and Dragons don't stand even at the toes of what Britannia had to offer.

In a world filled with expectations, responsibilities and limitations, your imagination is the only place where you can break lose. And what better place to nest that imagination in, than the inter-connected lands of a medieval land filled with wizards, dragons, damsels, armors and skills beyond any mastery existent today. You didn't step into a game, you stepped into a dream come true.

Such fascination sat deep inside me for many years after the commercial sense of humanity pushed UO to the sidelines in order to bring a new wave of games that companies could capitalize from through deceitfully created exchange systems. But the search for the Matrix and all the implications that it brings has made me discover many tastes, moments and skills that I thought were long gone. The desire to disconnect the thinking machine and light up the imaginative one has always been something I deeply covet.

Life gives you two choices: interact or isolate. If a life time of interaction sometimes pushes you to seek isolation in order to reset your perception, perhaps a life that mixes the strengths of both would yield a stronger and clearer vision. A man who creates incredible web platforms in the day and rides a dragon from the bank to his castle at night, is a happy man.
