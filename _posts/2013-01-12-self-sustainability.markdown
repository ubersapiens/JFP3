How about that lemonade stand or that pirated movie business? Must have made you a few bucks in the day. A sense of self-dependance that no other affair could have yielded. Why? Because you were able to monetize on something that you were able to make better than others.

Fast forward 15 years.

How do those cubicle walls feel? Probably not better than those of your daddy’s friends vice president office? If you are not out there busting your ass, living in minimalism, attempting to create something that swims against the current, against the common world, then you are skydiving with the parachute open since jumping.

Let’s jump back again to the past. Prehistoric age. Primitive hunting man. Goes out into the wild for 1 week. Chases a mammoth high into a mountain. Weather turns the conditions unbearable. Ice Age descends upon the planet. Man has two choices: learn to live in the cold or freeze to death. Now this is the closest analogy I could find to today’s business startup stage. Homo sapiens. 21st Century. No coding connaissance. Will be predatored into second row by tech savvy, anti-digital head scalping entrepreneurs. Or he could choose to jump into the rabbit hole and see the world through Ruby eyes.

Millions of people wake up every day and think, wow, I think I have a million dollar idea. How about we start growing hemp as a private company with permits in a given jurisdiction and slowly market it to the world as the world’s number sustainably polyvalent source? Incredible idea. Yes. Doable. Not today. Going from idea to product or from dream to reality is not as simple. But if you can code you have the Tsar bomb of tools in your arsenal in the world of digital innovation. Why? Because no other discipline in the knowledge world, aside from those heavily linked with programming already (math, physics), can give you the ability to solve problems posed before you on an hourly basis. Therefore, your way of seeing the world also becomes binary, you start seeing your flow of ideas as zeros and ones. Failures or successes.

Not only that but the idea of never developing a routine. Never having the same offices, the same surroundings. Never depending on a particular service or an annoying client. How about living in a small box, with a small window? Working today at the Starbucks in X street. Tomorrow working at the Starbucks in J street. And the day after working from your rooftop. Meeting people at cocktail parties or having dinner with friends, and experiencing the standard social exchange revolving around “what do you do”, some even exchanging business cards. Then you get the spotlight. You begin by saying how you spent months learning from Code Academy, Stanford U and Programr. You start explaining the new service or app that you are developing, the cool RPG you made last night or the hacking script you used to print for free at a library. No one gets it, because to them you will always be that guy that studied law, business, accounting, international affairs, whatever…liberal. But once the Matrix runs in your veins you cannot stop it. That minute chooses you. Just like it chose Neo. Just like it chose Alice. And when it chooses you. Get ready.

A bit of comedic factual evidence: What the 4 Hour Workweek forgot to mention within it’s global blockbuster self-employed manifesto was that a creative coder with an entrepreneur’s peripheral vision is the sabertooth tiger of the New World. What if I wrote how an entrepreneur learned coding and went on to create the million downloads app?
