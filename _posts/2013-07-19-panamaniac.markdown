You can feel the humidity crunch you upon arriving to the airport, but after a few minutes you can feel that cool ocean breeze sweeping by. Lying in the middle of the American landmass and providing the only passage through the continents, Panama certainly is the region's gem. With 3.5 million people along its 1000km long isthmus it harbors the world's biggest variety of flora and fauna per square meter. But it's not this that shocks you when entering the metropolis. A concrete jungle with nothing to envy from Miami or Caracas. 80 story buildings. Modern architecture. Peruvian sushi places. Seafood fusion cuisine. E! recognized clubs. Rooftop lounge orgies. And a giant dark sail that rises over the horizon to personify, in every way, the country's conscious endeavors. But it's the day after, when you wake up with that delicious taste of Ron Abuelo, that you will get a real look at Panama...the paradise.

The jungles of Darien are known worldwide, specially for serving as the only natural blockade in the path of the Inter American highway, which runs all the way from Alaska to Ushuaia. Forests with trees that reach into the skies, with neighbors that can count the centuries in their rings. Jungles and parks near the city can give you a sort of escape from civilization that only Narnia could give to a curious child. Mountain biking. Trekking. Camping. Bird watching. Day tripping. Running. It doesn't matter what you come here to do, nature will always surprise you. Whether it's colorful parrots crossing the pink skies at sunset or howler monkeys thumping their chests between long deep noise-making, the deep green is home to those who are not scared of it.

The thinnest part of an entire landmass was chosen by different nationalities and brilliant engineering minds to be the point where the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea would touch, solving the trading world's biggest challenge. The Canal along with the Old town sit as the cornerstones of a Panama that gained global recognition in the past and that still holds on to these two gems as the epicenter of the city's culture. On one side you have the gargantuan floating steel carrying commerce from one side of the world to the other. Waiting to be packaged. Put in a shop. Placed in the hands of ten thousand consumers. On the other side you have the deteriorating beauty of Casco Viejo, the old French colonial quarter of the city. 500 year old churches. Gold altars. Trendy lofts. Sitar playing rooftop yoga studios. And little plazas where spending an afternoon feels like a dive in historic delight.

With more beach-variety per capita than any other country in the world, you couldn't choose a better place to brave the sea. Pacific and Caribbean coasts give Panama's beaches a gamma of colors, waves, animals and sea decoration. Whether in the turquoise hollow tubes rolling into Bocas del Toro's shores or in the dark high seas of Pi√±as Bay, the fun is never ending. Grab a surfboard. Jump on a shipping vessel. Sit on a kayak. Or just plug your ears and head deep.

It has always surprised me, how a nation so inclined towards this liquid Zen-inducing element could metamorph into the horizon-less megapolis that sits as its capital. Japanese sages have headed towards the water-surrounded Okinawa to extend life. Indian sadhus have headed towards glaciar rivering Himalayan towns to seek peace. Amazonic shamans have headed towards never-ending waterfall jungle depths to seek time seizure. So why does the Panama man put himself in concrete boxes 100 meters into the air instead of settling in a wooden beach house and waking up to the tranquil sound of the ocean every morning?

Surprising beauty can be found in every inch of this country's territory and in upcoming months I will venture its highlands to later tell the world how I saw the two oceans from the top of a volcano.
