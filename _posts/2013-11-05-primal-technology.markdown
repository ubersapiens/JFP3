It is a bit 1984rish to discuss the evolution of technology and its epidemic effect on humanity’s continuance. But it is an issue that we either address or become extinct (in a certain way). Many people hated Ridley’s Prometheus but if you judge the movie solely on Guy Pearce’s TED speech, then the movie is a solid 10.0. Why? Because in 3 mins, Pearce’s megalomaniac character delivers a window into what the world will become. Despised by many, and misjudged by more, Prometheus nonetheless gave a peripheral look at the root of the problem.

But why Prometheus? Mythology’s titan was not only a colossus but an expert craftsman. Blacksmithing has long been regarded as the holding pillar of the Middle Ages. Think Lord of the Rings. Think MMORPG games. Not a single armor, sword or contraption would have been conceived without the incredible gift of hammer and forge. But how does it all connect? Just like mechanics or coding, blacksmithing made its wielders curious about how the world worked, how to make it better. The search for innovation. It is here that Prometheus decided to change everything. He knew that something uncomprehensively incredible had to be originated. So he stole it.

Prometheus stole something that made its victimized proprietors lash at him with the anger of a thousand Gods, because that is exactly what they were. He was chained to a rock formation in the middle of the ocean. A child of erosion, thousands of years of changing tides and floating corals. This became his world. At least for a few minutes a day. For the other 23 hours, Zeus and his lot arranged for a gigantic eagle to peck at the captor’s liver with ravaging voracity, which would regenerate at the end of the day, only to be eaten again, and again. But why such draconian measures? Why the excessively malicious torture? What did he steal?

Fire.

The titan gave humanity their most primal technology. Their first grasp at innovation. Disruption. Fire went on to inspire everything from tools and the wheel, to flying cars and traveling to space. It redefined the picture. Man was now able to grab a burning branch hit by lighting, bring it into his cave and light a fire that would burn for months. From there cooking, heating and crafting came to existence. Diets changed. Conditions improved. Man got smarter as a result of a god-stolen treasure. We invented gunpowder, lightbulbs, automobiles, airplanes, internet.

But we have suddenly hit a bump. How did we go from creations such as electricity and nuclear weapons to Instagram and Kindle? How did we go from launching Apollos and creating ships to cross the oceans to Facebook and iPods? Our sense of innovation has become so fragmented into focusing on the cubicle vision that there are only a few out there that continue to invent. Why would we burn entire libraries of classics, memorable literature and amazing discoveries, only because innovationless man invented the eReader? Why would we stay at home and in the office for countless hours staring at our friend’s latest purchase or a famous person’s self-indulgence on reality media, only because innovationaless man created social networks? If we continue to be sapped by the desire not to innovate, but to please the crowds, then the Squares, the Space Xs and the Teslas will become fewer and fewer, and the Angry Birds empire will dump us into idiotocracy. That’s when it becomes 1984. When mankind’s ignorance surrenders it into bullied banal submission.

The solutions to this alterable existence are similar to the original idea of the fire taming titan’s persona. We might remember him for sprinting down Olympus with a torch, but before that, Prometheus was just a craftsman. His craft shaped his curiosity into a question. Which then became a challenge. Ending up as defiance. Complete disruption.

A man who sees a world filled with humans cannot see the root of the problem. A man who pierces through the veil and notices roaming hard drives, starts understanding. Human beings have been reformatted by the Ivy Leagues and the Wall Streets into believing that a life in suitful monetization will be the ultimate fulfillment. When in reality, it’s those sitting in the labs of CalTech and the halls of Laussane’s incubators that will give humanity continuos braingasms. The answer to it all is craft. Someone who builds, codes, makes, repairs, connects or creates is more likely to spark a lightbulb than someone  who signs, drafts, approves, pays or golfs.

Be a dynamo. Learn a craft. Create things for fun, for amazingness. Get curious. Disrupt the world. Use Prometheus as an idea to be. Maybe you can best him. He stole primal technology.

Can you magically originate it?
