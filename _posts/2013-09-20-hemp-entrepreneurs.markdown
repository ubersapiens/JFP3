It is amazing how perceptive innovation can create entirely new industries ready to be exploited by those first cowboys ready to ride into the new open horizons. By perceptive innovation I refer to the ability of the human mind, and that usually involves millions of minds, to accept or recognize a new idea. Your thought process innovates towards perceptive openness. One such story involves marijuana. An element viewed as a threat to the Earth for the last 70 years due to the close-minded leaders of the United States of America. However, times change, trends change, minds change.

A former Microsoft executive and Washington state resident is planning to enter the upscale marijuana business, in the hopes that it will help bring some respectability to the industry. Jamen Shively plans to name his business after his grandfather, who supplied hemp rope to the Spanish Armada at the time of the Spanish-American War. By creating the category of premium marijuana, they want to position it similar to a fine cognac, a fine brandy, a fine cigar. What Kentucky became for bourbon, the state of Washington is becoming for marijuana. Marijuana will no longer be viewed as the dodgy entertainment of gangs in dark alleys and of curious high schoolers below the stadium’s benches. It will now be seen as a field of exploration. An orange worth squeezing.

The same evil empire that black listed marijuana from the world, has taken initial steps to show the rest of its sheep that they were wrong. Washington and Colorado now sit in similar jurisdictional status as the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland and Canada. But on December 6 they will take a leap ahead when legalization comes into action and possession/growth will become OK for everyone above 21 years old.

The Microsoft executive turned green entrepreneur brought me flashbacks of a very revealing movie that I saw the other day. Olive Stone has graced us with amazing films throughout his cinematographic existence. All of them are probably better than his last one, but it is his last one that showed me that an entrepreneur can combine passion and talent to create his ideal existence. Savages tells an action-packed story of cross-border gang wars, corrupt police departments, an incomprehensible threesome and the search to create the world’s most amazing marijuana. One of the main characters grabbed his love for herbology and his talent for business, sharpened them by majoring and acing both fields at UC Berkeley, and went on a search to biologically engineer the best green anyone had ever seen. A combination of strength, flavor, side effects and of course, plant vs nature supremacy. He searched for the only place where he could setup a full blown Edisonesque garage to work on his niche, and he got to work. California already had an established high-end medical marijuana market, but that was not the competition. There was no competition. The idea was to create an iPod when everyone had 8-track players. Months of research led him to the ends of the world. Burma, then Kenya, then Panama, finally, everything pointed towards Afghanistan. Strains were imported from every corner of the ex-war zone. They were paired and studied with California’s and Netherlands’ finest. The best ones were crossed and their offsprings were crossed. The super hybrid that emerged from this small opportunity of playing God was awe-striking. A solution for the ill, the sad, the injured, the lost, the searchers of creativity and drive. Green entrepreneurship was born!

It is a just a matter of time before the rest of the world sees the potential of marijuana to reduce alcohol consumption, medical impediments and emotional discrepancies. Imagine places like Santa Cruz, the Hague and Vancouver. Innovation, vanguardism, coolness and best of all, open-minded crowds. One door will eventually another, pointing towards an even bigger contribution to the world in the form of hemp. The polyvalent cash crop will revolutionize and improve the paralyzed industrial planet with a greener solution. And then the world will smile simultaneously.
