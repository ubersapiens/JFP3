For the past couple of months, I have been contemplating the idea of learning to code. But not in the sense that might first come to mind: it’s not becoming the PC fixer at a shop or a Korean boy stored in a hangar writing pirated operating systems. It’s not a search to learn a science. It’s more of need to learn a craft. You don’t need to be the best blacksmith to make a sword, but you do have to be the best alchemist to make a good potion. Therefore, learning to code is a necessary evil in a certain way, but one that could become a weapon of great enjoyment in times to come.

Making a decision to embark in such journey is the same as standing in the shores of Panama and saying ‘I’d like to learn Japanese’. Reading downwards. Flipping the pages backwards. Symbols replacing words. Samurai etymology. It’s not that easy. So you think again, ‘What language could I learn?’. One that is useful? Or one that I like? Or one that is globally spread? In the end it becomes a headache and very often you abandon your will. Same problem with coding.

Computers understand numerous languages coming from different parts of the world in all shapes and styles. But choosing one does not only put you in the crowd of those linguistically clustered, it also puts you in their clan. Join an IRC channel and ask about programming. If you get more than no answers at all, you’ll probably get ten. Each one of a different user. Hacker. Designer. Anarchist. Game maker. Random. And each one advocating for a different language. It starts getting funny when you start noticing the demographic divisions within the Matrix. The script hackers (Python). The Android developers (Java). The iPhone douches (Objective C). The trendy samurai (Ruby). It’s like choosing clans.

Your trial and error experience takes you into buying numerous programming books. Some costing around the initial investment you wanted to make on your app or website. You then subscribe to various programming courses, lectures, projects. End up getting bombarded with over enthusiastic teens in Bangladesh and Burma who have enrolled in your same classes, along with 50,000 other people. One step further into tasting hara kiri is hiring a e-lancing programmer to teach you how to write a photo sharing system.

If I was ever stubborn, this was on the top of that list. Imagine sitting down with three different coding languages, not at the same time, for one month. During that month I jumped from coffee shop to library and from Starbucks to a park. Often spending 8 hours per day hammering in material but at the same time, day dreaming about the things that I would be doing once I could code but never really filtering them as realistic or just whims of inspiration. The efforts often led to frustration that stopped progress for a day or two and eventually for good.

But I never gave up on the idea. I knew Chinese was not the language of the future. Code is.

Psychologist must have an explanation but if we were able to have our minds as child’s at our disposal the world would be full of greener cities, flying skateboards, floating buildings and no one would be hungry. That being said, I looked way back into my early teens when I first started getting curious about computers. It was a time of Doom, Turbo Pascal, Ultima Online and 56k tunes. For entire nights, from midnight till 6am, I was able to sit in front of that blue screen and write down word processors, shop databases, text based games and even a snake game. It didn’t stop there. Trojans, scripts, phreaking, backdoor Cracking the online world seemed more interesting than solving any of the problems in real life. Why? Because this was the trend. This was the new thing and curious people were trying to find out what made it all tick.

I remember writing a program in Pascal when I was 13 years old. It was an inventory handler that I had written to keep track of the movies and albums that people had requested for me to download. It also kept track of my blank CD stock and my cash flow. Simple program. But it solved a big problem that I had. If i I didn’t have something keeping track of my orders or my expenses I would end up with very little in the end. Eventually I got rid of that program and kept track of everything on a notepad. Instead I used algebra learned in school to create a program that counted down on every sale to eventually reach a target sales amount. If I’m not mistaken I wanted to buy a new bicycle at the time.

Putting myself in that mental status again I just told myself I wanted to build something. To create a solution to a problem. I needed a coding language that was comprehensive, simple, straight forward, powerful, clean and hacker respected. Why would you learn to hammer boards if you want to build sword? Imagine using that same analogy. You sit in lotus position. Your daily 2o minutes of zazen. You see a blade. You open your eyes and decide you want to make a new knife, the katana. You don’t need to be a master silversmith, just an adept one with lots of determination and vision.

So how do you learn such a craft? It is easy for a carpenter to show an apprentice how to look at the angles of the wood and how to sharpen the edges of the chair’s legs, but a programming master cannot teach his young padawan in the same way, instead, this craft resembles more the game of chess. One which can only be perfected through solid practice and curiosity. Coding follows a similar rubric.

So what about the other languages?

Java goes back to his Hut. Ruby goes jump on the Rails. C stays as objective as ever.

I choose to join Monty Python’s Lonely Hack the World Band!

But what makes you a hacker? No better way than to dig into the dark tunnels of the underground chat servers where Anonymous refuges and hacker aficionados lurk the channels. Some of them follow codexes, others fly solo. But the best hackers are those who learn to be great at their craft and then find those who compliment their vision and their projects. It’s just like building a hunting clan in an RPG. If you are the wise mage, you still need healers, warriors, tamers, and engineers. Hackers are today’s problem solvers. They see a world with errors waiting to be fixed. Imagine putting that mentality outside of the IBM and into the real world. Quirurgic research to be made on hackers, the way of being.
