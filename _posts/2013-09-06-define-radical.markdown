I have never liked the United States as a brain farm. It has brought to the world genius individuals like Edison, Ford and Disney, but along with that, it has brought a swarm of ignorance and misfired hate. A nation bred day by day to live in fear. What Orwell did to the 1984ish soulless masses, the US did to its people. Every powerful entity dreams with complete and utter control over their targeted field of vision. In this case the individual. The masses. And what better way of control than fear? An angry dog can attack you, a happy one can run away, but a scared one, will never leave your sight.

Poor education. Media-driven bombardment. Those and many other factors have turned a nation of industrialists and innovators into a state of embraced jingoism manifesting a ‘king of the hill’ approach over the rest of the planet. A country raised to see the army as the ultimate service you could give your country. Overfeeding them to a point of disgust towards the tenderest pleasures of life. Concussioning them in every football game or frat fight. Traumatizing them day by day in a desert 10,000 miles away from home with absolutely no enemy threats and a small Muslim population living in a village nearby.

Those same men and women, that underwent the standard American breeding system, came back to wake up every day to CNN telling them that Uzbekistan has nuclear weapons and drone forces are being deployed, FOX telling them that some kid in Wyoming shot 233 children in a farm, and last but not least, ESPN telling them that Tom Brady is a transexual. So how do you expect a human being with this neural framework to be able to tolerate, to accept, to try and to forgive? They snap. And that is when unnecessary causes lead to war, to hunger, to suffering. Not everyone is an enemy. Not everyone with a turban, or with darker skin, or with a long thick beard, or even from another religion, or speaking another language, is an enemy. The average american would rank that entire description into the phrase ‘radical islam’, or even just the word ‘insurgent’.

But not everyone is alike. You have people in California, Portland and Washington looking at ways to improve the world, the way of thinking and the direction we are going. I wouldn’t say the same about the Confederates. Change takes time, but the with the initial wheels turning the moment shall take care of the rest. Ignorance can be a very imposing barrier but once a few open minds begin to see the light, others will follow.

The engine that drove the world into the automobile age, the space age and the Internet age still has some field to cover. Why waste time persecuting falsely accused religious groups, innocent sovereign nations and humble struggling races?

Think about it.

Kuwait. Iraq. Afghanistan. Do you want to know what radical Islam looks like…
