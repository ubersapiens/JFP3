If you are a health hacker, like I am, you have probably jumped out of the boxed four-wall fitness center mentality and into the outdoor world of anatomic performance enhancement. You see, it is quite impressive to go every day at 6:30pm to your local gym and do a chest/triceps routine for one hour. An hour that also included watching the TVs on the wall, the mirrors all around you, the hot college girls in the steppers and the occasional chat with a friend. That is just a waste of time. I used to be bound to this confined concept, but only to build strength; it was the outdoors that always seemed to call me for everything else. Building strength, a funny concept. Let's define what building strength means to the world. Ask 95% of the population what they think of when they put the 'building strength' concept in their periphery. The answer will surely be: get big and musclely. Useless. It is that other 5% that you should listen to. The caveman, the ultramarathoner, the bar athlete. One that has as an ultimate goal to produce force and momentum. Forget the filled T-shirts. Real strength wins arm wrestling contests and street fights, not deadlift tournaments and biceps curling challenges.

So I began to look around, to research, to observe and to read. It is quite easy to say, I will go lift rocks to build strength, when you live in the beach or next to a construction. Most of the world lives in cities. So where do you build strength in a concrete jungle? Flashback. A few weeks ago I was running in the park and as I passed by a kid's playground I noticed something impressive. A man, grasping a sign's pole, erected himself horizontally, forming a type of human flag. What an incredible sight. Strength, core power, control. The human flag is arguably the most visually impressive bodyweight feat of strength anyone's ever come up with. Any time someone does a human flag, it inevitably attracts attention and for good reason.

Planet of the Apes was a great movie wasn't it? It pits evolution's closest species in a fight for control and power over the other. I recalled the movie not for its greatness, but for something it proved. Apes are incredibly stronger than us. You see chimpanzees pulling themselves effortlessly from branch to branch, ultimate control of their core, strength and movement. This complete body control allows 35 kilo chimps to have the punching strength of a 100 kilo adult human. Let's not even get started with their less agile yet far more powerful cousins, the gorillas. An animal capable of reproducing the strength of 10 Olympic athletes. But why the zoological approach? Because it all boils down to the trees. The fun in just doing what feels natural and not what feels forced, planned or uncomfortable. A person that goes to a CrossFit class 3 days a week is someone who takes time of his life to workout. A person who will do 50 pushups at random times of the day and spontaneously throw in a pullups session at the children's playground in the corner takes time out of his workout to live.

Calisthenics are a form of exercise consisting of a variety of simple, often rhythmical, movements, generally without using equipment or apparatus. They are intended to increase body strength and flexibility with movements such as bending, jumping, swinging, twisting or kicking, using only one's body weight for resistance. They are usually conducted in concert with stretches. Calisthenics when performed vigorously and with variety can benefit both muscular and cardiovascular fitness, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility and coordination' (wiki). So then what becomes the ideal way to build that coveted physical prowess? The body is stimulated by three forces: push, pull and hold. In a basic setup, one would be worked by pushups, the other by pullups and the other by planks. But since everything tastes better with a bit of spice, the variation can turn into a crippling routine. A combination of: degree changing pushups, chinups, wide grip pullups, twisting ab planks, suspended ab crunches and a 10K run. Try it every day with one day rest per week and watch yourself turn green with power. Combining everything (push, pull, hold) to resemble natural movement can create optimum effect.

We have seen a surge of natural movement pushers, caveman routines, barefoot/minimalist nature challenges and rock lifting Atlas followers, all trying to have a go at the throne. But never has research been more oriented towards the concoction of calisthenics and running as the recipe for being a titan. It is ironic that technology has taken us to the Moon yet an old playground will beat any state-of-the-art fitness facility in terms of building strength. Primal strength is the state of power held by our ancestors thousands of years ago. It advocates the use of nature and of our bodies to reach anatomic ecstasy.

Pushups and pullups have been crowned accordingly as the kings of muscle building, strength creating and movement facilitating exercises in the fitness kingdom. Yet so many people drop them for bench presses and Yates pulls. While I was a victim of this school of thought, I can also defend it by saying that at younger ages we are looking to build faster muscle no matter what quality it is. But as many have before me, the quest for superior performance leads to higher knowledge as well, which combined with an unlimited reservoir of motivation can yield great innovations in the "working out" and "being healthy" spheres.

Try the following workouts out for a few weeks and let me know what it does to your body, your strength, your flexibility and your performance day to day:

<span id ="focus">Endurance</span>

10-15k runs twice per week

<span id ="focus">Speed</span>

Tabata sprints once a week


<span id ="focus">Strength</span>

Upper body pull (orange muscles): pullups, chinups, muscle ups and any variation of pull (vertical, horizontal or angled)

Upper body push (beige muscles): standing presses, pushup variations, triceps extension

* Core strength (pink and fuchsia muscles): leg raises, hanging abs movements, angled positions held for time, planks

Lower body strength (blue, purple and green muscles): developed through sprinting (if necessary growing is targeted opt for for squatting stones, sacks or any easy to pickup weighted prop)

* One of the biggest pros of calisthenics is that it focuses on the strength of the core towards the rest of the body in order to create a perfect balance between the two halves and the two movement forces. Look at the diagram on the right. Both top and bottom have heavy weighted muscles right next to the core while the extremities are controlled by smaller, faster twitch muscles. Building a strong core should be a priority to anyone.

The irony of evolution: Monkey evolves into Man. Man observes his Monkey ancestors and their approach to strength. Man decides to go Monkey.
