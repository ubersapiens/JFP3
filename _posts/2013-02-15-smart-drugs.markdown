I have been doing some research a bit on the unethical, yet limitless, side. Things like standardized tests (GMATs), Calculus proofs (deep Math) and complex languages (C++) require our minds to be in a higher state of some sort in order to cope with the demanding exigences of such an intrinsic approach to knowledge. Why? Because we are simply not wired that way. Stephen Hawking might be. But we aren't.

So it is this realization that has spawned a nation of nature tampering supermen who have ventured into challenging their biologic configurations in order to extract the most powerful results, within new limits. To look into the worlds of chemistry, physics, medicine, and other humanly-connected spheres and find those elements that would complement our anatomical performance. It is the field we now know as biohacking.

But how can you identify with any of these experimental existences if you are just an average Joe sitting in a cubicle? The answer is extremely simple. Any intellectual challenge that has been pinching your cerebellum for a while now. Any fear-inducing text that has been on your to-do list for the past year. Any hands on creation that you had proposed and had run away after the first minute of building. These are all identifiable situations.

Once the idea of wanting to hack your own anatomy is there, the rest is just enjoying the ride.

Biohacking starts with a Matrix-like scene.

Let's say you decide to take the red pill. Except this time it's not flashy jellybean that Morpheus had in his hand. Your arsenal is way bigger than that. Give the alphabet a swing and you will start seeing Aderall, Concerta, Provigil, Ritalin and many others in between. For years the ADHD generation and the autistic crowds have been exploited by medicine to enhance noticeable differences in their mental composure in order to bring out their super genes. Why shouldn't we? But taking a neural enhancers just like that would be like if Neo chucked it without having an idea of the hacker existence within a programmed universe. Knowledge is the only good. It is the chalice in your Indiana Jones quest.

Take the last choice for example, Ritalin, and hit the internet knowledge button. You will see in a few seconds how moderate doses of this Faustish dream can increase learning speed and task focus/precision. Research has proven it boosts both of these cognitive abilities by increasing the activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine deep inside the brain. It has been demonstrated that one type of dopamine receptor aids the ability to focus, and another type improves the learning process itself. The scientists also established that Ritalin produces these effects by enhancing brain plasticity, strengthening communication between neurons where they meet at the synapse. Research in this field has accelerated as scientists have recognized that our brains can continue to form new connections, remain plastic, throughout life.

But all that can be read over and over through various blogs, websites and articles. What better way of knowing if it works than to be the dark knight? The scorned guinea pig who goes against all odds to change the world. To defy logic.

Self experimentation idea: 10 days, controlled Ritalin dosage, intellectual examination and tests. To make it even more exciting, the entire process will be documented and every few dates updates will be placed with accompanying research and progress (to be continued).

Biohacking is not a science or a medical pursuit or even a new field. It is a sense of curiosity that crawls into rare individuals forcing them to question the boundaries that the world sets on us while having the physical and mental constitution to jump over Everests and ooze with algorithmic proofs. It is a way of telling nature that we can also innovate.

Put it into perspective. Imagine reading of the enormous raging mammoths being chased by RedBull-spiked Neanderthals. Smart drugs offer the same leap in immediate evolution adaptable to the environment that we live in today, in the 21st Century, not in the Paleolithic age. We have the right to become curious about the untapped regions of the brain that when accurately activated, could create the phenomenon known to math geniuses and computer wizards as unleashing your brain. Whole other game!
