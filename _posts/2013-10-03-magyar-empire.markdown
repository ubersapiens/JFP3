Oh what a surprise this place gave me. You hear of places that are magic and fun and mysterious and wild but not all in the same mix. Budapest will always hold a top5 star in my head.

Staying in the Jewish Quarter and the St. Stefan Basilica area is primordial; that’s the epicenter of all that moves. Besides, having this cathedral close by for late night re-entries or morning wanderings is quite the sight.

If you come from Prague and Bratislava, the ambience will feel like heaven after just experiencing a few days of calorically dense local cuisine, the alcoholically high drink percentages and the extremely late hours of sleeping.

Walking every corner of the city can be done on a nice day, with a strong pair of legs. Meaning if you dedicate two days to harvesting the city by foot and an extra day if you wish you put in a bit museum entries, a visit to the zoo or just extra mindfulness time.

Admire the architecture that made the Austro-Hungarian empire one admired and cherished by every historian when comparing it to the Ottoman, the Roman and others. Go to the Buda side and look at what I would call the historic half of the city. Explore all of it. Look at the amazing detail in the statues. The horses, the armors, the weapons. Specially look at an enormous one in Buda Palace that looks like the Fontana de Trevi in Rome but with warriors ready for Armageddon, except for one extremely chilled out guy on the right sitting cross legged with a hawk and a German shepherd (recognized as the first ‘pimp’ in history). Embrace the panoramic view of the Parliament, the river, the mountain on the right.

Then take a walk up the river and cross over into the small island between the bridges. This small park holds reindeer inside. If you get lucky you will see a few. Walking up the island is fairly smooth. From the tip of the island turn right and walk this long street until you get to the cross with Andrassy avenue, an amazing street where the embassies, the style and the beauty of high class Budapest lies. But to your left will be the amazing Hero’s gate along with a beautiful park and a castle on its back. This travesty will deliver many surprises on its path so be wary.

As per the nightlife. Chilling out is definitely a low-key scene in comparison to other cities like Spain, Netherlands or Czech, but as in all other places, the students are always cool. The area of the Jewish Quarter holds some of the hippest night spots. BOB, Szimpla Kert and Traffiq are all I will say with regards to going out. Dedicate a night on each. You will see why if the world was going to end and they to pick the perfect most beautiful creature to start a new line of reproduction, they would go to Hungary.
