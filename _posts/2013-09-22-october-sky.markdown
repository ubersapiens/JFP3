As kids we all had hobbies. We had GI Joes. We played laser shots. We practiced karate. We all dreamed of having superpowers.

One day I decided to start building rockets.

I don’t know if it was because I watched that October Sky movie or because I was curious to send a man-made vehicle into space or maybe it was just because I liked fire and explosions. One way or another I developed a passion for what the world knows as rocket science. But this sphere reserved for the human elite is not as complex as it might seem when you are staring at Cape Cañaveral live. You see, as I have usually mentioned, it all comes down to breaking it up into its basic parts. A rocket does not have to put a man into space or have 1 million tons of fuel to exit the stratosphere. Broken down a rocket is just an aerodynamic casing, a propulsion system and a recovery mechanism. We can basically make a rocket with a hollow aluminum tube, nylon string, aery plastic and lots of  zinc-sulfur propellant.

I bet you Elon Musk must have had his fun hours with model rockets as a kid; that’s what inspired him decades after to give Space X to the world. We have crowded all the land, the ocean is too expensive to access, so the skies are the future. Maybe if we had model rocket building in school as part of the science curriculum or even as an elective of its own, a few mavericks would end up failing French on purpose but building some mean ass toy Predators. The problem is hackers and activists would turn an exploratory platform for kids to play NASA scientists into a drone factory to force the governments into WW3.

Rockets are our means of reaching other worlds and finding an alternative to a planet that is being rapidly consumed. However, a pursuit of trendy technology has turned prolific space programs, like Russia’s and the US’s, into fourth row priority. NASA could even be put next to KODAK in the box of anti-innovative tech giants. It is wild entrepreneurs, like Musk and like Richard Branson, who have taken the discovery of the frontier into their hands. A few more kids building rockets could be the answer to the incoming wave.
