I was standing in the metro today listening to some incredible deep house when an image became an idea which then became a revelation.

Out of 14 kids that were in my same wagon, 9 of them had screens on their hands and 7 of those were playing Angry Birds. The age range I was looking at was 10-15 years old.

At that same age I was not slingshotting parrots into the air to knock down Jenga towers. Just like every single curious kid in the planet, I played strategy games. Warcraft, Age of Empires and Risk were amongst the most engaging challenges anyone could call entertainment. Whether you chose global domination or medieval fantasy battles, the approach was still the same. Just like an old man contemplates a backgammon board before distributing his next roll, the online commander also looks at the battle field prior to launching his next attack. Many might have developed obsessive compulsive behaviors towards some of these games, more in the RPG crowd, but it is undeniable that they where built by smart individuals challenging you products of their imagination.

StarCraft, a real-time strategy game from Blizzard Entertainment, has been labeled the chess of the 21st century. Cognitive scientists are using it to study memory, decision-making, and motor skills. Can you imagine what it is like to be able to biohack yourself with Modafinil and play campaign after campaign, relentlessly, for 30 hours? Asian super powers have been training thousands of children through strategic computer games such as StarCraft while maintaining their focus and dedication throughout their teenage years with smart drugs. The soldiers of tomorrow are not going to be fighting in the beaches of Normandy, they will be fighting a cyber war sitting in a bunker.

According to Fast Company’s article on Starcraft, it is “the greatest learning tool that isn’t being taught in any school”. Why? Because it moulds the brain of a person into a Swiss army from a very young age. That only continues to grow and develop once the foundation is laid. Literature, extracurriculars, ambitions and approach to life will all be influenced by those years of strategic game play. In the 1980s the best training you could have in the world was the one given to the US Navy Seals. It was inhumane and if you completed it, you were considered one of the strongest, toughest and most prepared humans in this planet. Now the best survival skillset you can have for the 21st Century comes in a DVD and costs $39.99.

Imagine what happens if we grab all the George Bushes and Mitt Romneys of the world and instead of giving them the 1960s-70s version of Angry Birds and Draw Something, we gave them Age of Mythology and Dark Age of Camelot. Game changing. You would have more Switzerlands and more Uruguayan presidents around the world. Smart people create incredible things out of their most disruptive dreams for people with a desire to discover, to solve and to enjoy. Join the RPG/Strategic game revolution. It is said that the next wave will bring us the Steve Jobs of biological hacking. Well, what if it brought the next Napole
