You normally don’t look at the spinning globe and decide you’ll go to Iceland. There has to be something extremely incredible that drags you towards the island in the northern Atlantic Ocean. A place where only Vikings dared to venture in past centuries.

Iceland has a bit over 300,000 inhabitants in the entire surface and 75% live in the capital, Reykjavik. A peculiar city with its low architecture in the center and modern design on the waterfront. Churches that look like space rockets or even more bizarre, archeological pyramids. The island has an interesting history, dominated mainly by its inhabitation of Vikings. Now sitting amongst the top 15 most developed countries in the world, Iceland used to be one of the most abandoned Norse settlements in the first millennium. There direct lineage with Thor made them people of the North. While the blood was then tinted with Gaelic influence, the people of Iceland have spoken the same North Germanic language of always. Tough, dry and to the point. But with that said, the ratio of beautiful women (using De Matteo’s standard system) is 9/10. Meaning that you will need to try hard to find ugly girls and those that rank as ugly, are probably right in your top range. But beware, unless you want to be met with a massive epidemic of pregnant women, go between September and December. Since Iceland only gets about 1 hour per day in the cold winter, people resort to other types of recreation. Take into consideration the ratio established earlier.

If you like to try things out of the ordinary, go to any traditional restaurant in the city or in one of the towns and you will be definitely tested as a culinary connoisseur. Try the reindeer burgers. They live in vast abundance in the entire island and even more in Scandinavia. Delicious, lean meat. Try penguin. I know, I also thought of happy feet. But you won’t regret it. Imagine salmon texture, but sweet taste. They normally have pictures of penguin islands in the restaurants to prove to you that they are overpopulated. Whale is another one that would be a delicious additive, as a main dish. The minke whale steak resembles a tuna steak. Do not try fermented shark! This is oversold as a delicatesse, when in fact it is the closest thing to trying a dead person’s flesh. They even serve it with two shots of ‘burning wine’, to ensure that you don’t make a scene.

Leaving the city lights is what brings so many people back to the emerald island. A recent headline projects it as the land of “Fire and Ice” with a red dragon scorching fire at a blue ice blowing wyvern. Iceland might be sitting at 66 North (latitude), but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t get hot. The entire island sits on steam. In fact 80% of its energy is produced from geothermal and hydraulic infrastructure. Take a hot bath at any 5 star hotel and you will feel like you are are showering in rotten eggs. Don’t worry, it’s just sulfur. The hot water does not need to be heated, it comes directly from the source.

Waterfalls, rivers, endless green characterizes the outsides of the metropolitan area. Going farther in land, you encounter glaciers, frozen lakes and volcanos. Therefore, for topographic variety, it’s not doing that bad at all. It is quite enjoyable to tour the southern part, near the coast where you will hobbit styled communities of Icelanders that have not left their villages since birth and that continue to practice the same lifestyle as those who arrive in the island some 200 years ago. Another great one is having a hot coffee, usually they make them out of special hydroponic grown blends, and running around the geyser parks that are all over. Skydiving. Fishing. Whale watching. Kayaking. Skiing. For those more into getting the heart pumping, glacier trekking is definitely the way to go. Picture yourself in a Sylvester Stallone movie climbing up a 200 meter ice wall with nothing but a pair of pickaxes and some sharp boots. Bad ass!

You see pictures and scenes. Hear rumors and stories. But there is no more visually grasping moment than seeing the Aurora Borealis dance in the Northern Sky right before your eyes. That creation of nature caused by the magnetic forces in the poles dazzling us with a kaleidoscope of projections adorning the dark starry skies.
