After being released into the seas I am now ready to return as a haigui, meaning sea turtle in Chinese slang and referring to those who have left the Oz to explore the world and then come back. I am moving back to London in a couple of days. Almost three years after having left, what was the best year of my life, I now go with other exploits in mind. As both a playground for daring students but also for imaginative venture seekers, it's the perfect place to go to when you have a motivation reservoir ready to flood whatever is in its path. Don't get me wrong but it's not a place for the weak and the slow. Like NY, the British capital will grab you as a big piece of wood and carve you into an fkin train. It's a fast city, a harassing city, a pushy city, an exotic city, a wild city but best of all, it is a fun city.

I started adding up in my head the things that I disliked when I was a student there and most of them started around the following line: leaving home walking and having to descend into the tube at mostly any hour. The suits at peak hours, the drunks at late hours, the lost picture takers at all hours. Add up the amount of money you spend on tickets or card recharges. Then add the times you really needed the tube, not those where you could have gotten there after a 20 minute walk. You will notice that at the end of the year that totals about 600 pounds on one side and less than 100 pounds on the other. So why spend all those monthly recharges, if you live in Central London, and could have saved up to 500 pounds in the process?

Of course, it's a fast city. That's probably why the tube would be the first thing to pop in your head. But what if you carried around a foldable bike? No matter what time and what place, unless it's raining cats and dogs, a bike will get you there faster or at the same time as the tube. Of course if you grab the Bakerloo line from one extreme to the other, you will beat the bike. But we are talking realistic scenarios. Most people coming into the City, Shoreditch, Canary Wharf, etc. will probably change a few times before arriving at their final destination. The funny thing is that if you give all of this, the kind of thought I have given it, you would notice that your journey would probably be way shorter, way more direct, and way way funner than your average 1984 displacement system.

So if you want to see the actual numbers here is how it works out:

Morden to Chancery Lane

16.5 km ---> 45-50 minutes bicycle vs 60-75 minutes tube

$ per yr ---> 250-350 pounds bicycle/urgnt-tickts vs 550-650 pounds tube

x factor ---> fun displacement vs potentially stressful

Not only did I contemplate three different aspects of the commuting experience (distance, cost, comfort), but I concentrated on the most important ones. At least in a city where every minute counts. When you live in Geneva or in Panama you can take your time to do things because you know that on the other end, whoever you are meeting, they will be in the same M.O. as you. But the Big Ben is always ticking in Jolly Ole London. Health, fun and disconnecting a big from Big Brother come second to always being on the move and always being productive. And by that I don't just mean generating profits. On the other hand, it focuses more on always doing something, no couchlocking. Studying, going to an interview, drinking pints, watching football, meeting friends, attending an event, going to a concert, and the list goes on an on. What is the best way to put all those things left behind into the equation? Well quite simple. To get from one Opera House to the pub and from the coffee shop to the tech academy you need to move. Voila!

Buy a bike. You will thank me later.
