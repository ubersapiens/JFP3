You wake up one day and just lay in bed looking at the roof. Thinking, wandering. A lot of what happened in the last couple of months can be seen in brief flashes. Decisions, moments, changes…jumping off a cliff and hoping build a plane on the way down.

So how about we write some of it down? Yep..let’s try that.

Coffee, bowl of quinoa, a carved mahogany buddha, 4 Hour Body and Apple’s arsenal lie around me, setting an ambience.

Looking at those flashes made me think of articles, books, stumbles, thoughts and tendencies to drift off the left side of the brain spectrum (a world of accountants, lawyers, consultants, traders)…and to embrace the Dark Side of the Brain (a planet of drawers, programmers, designers, architects).

We all have this side. It’s just sleeping.

If you ever built a slingshot, or drew a big red house, or sat with an instrument hearing a tune and wanting to Make it Better.

So this is my way of documenting this awakening. To face this conundrum, and any other, it’s wise to arm yourself with the necessary tools. Learn to sketch, to write a bug fixing script, to take the perfect photograph. Let’s take one at a time. Each project posted will deal with a skill. Each skill will deal with a vision. A mission.

This is post number 1.
