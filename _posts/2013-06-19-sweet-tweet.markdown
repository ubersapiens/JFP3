Having seen the progressive rise of Twitter in various parts of the world, before blowing up beyond proportions after the Arab Spring, I can vouch for the incredible tool it is. If you put it in a historical perspective, Twitter would more or less equal a forum in Greek and Roman times. A place of congregation and open speech. Now that is quite an accomplishment. Going from marble columns, open plazas and auditory infrastructures to 140 characters and that’s it.

The reason why I gave Twitter a bit of a nice introduction was because I have been using extensively in the last couple of weeks after finding out the immense communicative potential it had in the tech community. It was a bit obvious, I just hadn’t see it until now. Hackers, coders, devs and programmers choose the chirping bird as a medium to chat, share, discuss and even explode, if necessary. Perfect.

One of the main benefits from these short interactive bursts is that they follow Steve Job’s principle of ‘simple is more complicated’. 140 characters to share your opinion or discuss a subject is a bit of a daunting task for the wordy. So instead of it being an easy email or SMS, tweets make you think sharp. That is why it doesn’t matter if you are trying to put up a picture of your latest Raspberry hack or ask Jack Dorsey a question, you are just a quick @ away from tapping the digital world of open speech.
