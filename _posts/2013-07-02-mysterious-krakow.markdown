While many might prefer the capital of Poland for its recent progress and development in the 21st Century as one of Central Europe’s top metropolises, it’s little old Krakow that caught my attention many years ago, with its mix of feudal feelings and wartime memories. The city is filled with energy in the summer, when thousands of daring backpackers choose to degusté a bit what the USSR must have felt like. In the winter, it falls into silence as the piercing cold sweeps down from the Arctic. Krakow proudly boasts the best preserved and most intact Jewish ghetto post-World War 2. And forming the other side of the city’s ying yang is one of the most beautiful old towns in all of Europe. This hidden gem is also the most closely connected city to Pope John Paul II, since he was born in Wadowice, a small town just a few kilometres away.

No need to hesitate about where to stay. When I came to this place in the middle of nowhere, I had good inside information from friends that had been there a couple of years back. I still remember the stories of the crazy locals and the incredibly strong local alcohol, but it was the hostel part that popped my eyes. Goodbye Lenin sits quite near the Jewish ghetto and a short walk from the old town. Not only is this hostel out of the ordinary, but I can also certify it as the best low-cost accommodation I have ever encountered. Spacious bedrooms, indoor heated pool and a staff that could have switched the aprons for Victorias Secret lingerie any day of the week, and dazzled the catwalk. It was the ideal headquarters for a few days of wandering.

Although most tourists come to Krakow for its incredible summer parties, its beautiful women and its architecture, its what lies nearby its city center that became the highlight of my visit to this vast country. Wieliczka Salt Mine is one of those places where you will probably go once, not because it is so hard to access but because it leaves such an impression in you that you will forever hold it in your memory vaults. This salt mine, built in the 13th Century, that kept operating until 2007, was now a museum, sort of speak. Hundreds of feet below the surface, we descended into what I thought would be my last glimpse of the sun, only to find the most astonishing of places. Tunnels that stretched beyond what the eye could see used to serve as transport routes for the miners throughout several centuries. As we walked through some of these, I couldn’t help but let my jaw drop when I saw the masterpieces that these miners had incorporated into their usually dull, grey jobs. Sculpture after sculpture. Carving after carving. The guide explained to us that these miners were sometimes trapped in the mines for so long, that they developed artistic skills to shape the material which they rudimentary called their work. Everything from penguins to dwarfs, from John Paul II to the Mona Lisa. It was all there. An underground Louvre made of salt. And then I saw the most perfect rock carving I have ever seen.

Krakow has many incredible sights worth visiting, but even the amazing salt mines stood second to what I saw on the next day. World War 2 was witness to the monstrosity of a man and a nation supporting his vision. It was this same man who grabbed an innocent country, like Poland, and turned into his personal playground, or better said, his personal gulag. Numerous concentration camps were scattered throughout Polish lands but only one stands out as evidence of what one man’s madness can lead the world into. Auschwitz was a network of concentration camps established by the Nazis in, what was at the time, territory annexed to Germany. I still remember getting off the bus on a dark morning. No birds singing. No flowers blooming. It was March and the winter cold still loomed. I still remembering feeling a shiver down my spine as I walked through the iron gates reading  Arbeit macht frei (“work makes you free”). As I strolled from point A to point B my stomach turned from hearing the stories, seeing the pictures, standing in the showers and worst of all, closing my eyes and imagining it was still 1944. No book, movie or story can make anyone feel what I felt that day. And that is why I choose to leave out details so that those brave enough to stand where mankind’s most atrocious moments took place, can know what happened, so that they never, ever let it happen again.

Although it would be the perfect ending to leave the reader pensive about all the things that took place around this small area in southern Poland, it would be way better to end it with a punch. That night when I came back from Auschwitz, I felt shell shocked. As if everything I had seen that day would be burned in my memory and prevent me from pulling a smile for the next month. Yet in times of trouble one must search for those or that which brings happiness and brightness to one’s life. Those same friends that had recommended the hostel, also mentioned an Argentinean bar (out of all places in Krakow) where the few Latin American souls that inhabited the vicinity would go for drink of whatever they had that night. It just happens to be that the owners were there that night, and that they loved Panama and Panamanian boxing history. Coincidentally I love Argentina and Argentinean football history. So one conversation too many pushed the amazing hosts to bring out the heavy artillery: the only vodka in the world made from natural bee honey. And apparently, it was a Polish delicacy. Shot after shot of this delicious amber liquid, which was served with coffee beans on top to cut the sugary taste, and that is when it ended. Every single memory of that night, that followed those shots, will stay in that beautiful city that so warmly welcomed us…because in my head, there was nothing but void.
