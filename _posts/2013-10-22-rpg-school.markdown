Knowledge can be extracted from anything right. So if crafting, trading, economics, estate management, hierarchical comprehension and other indispensable skills to human survival were not taught at school, where do you get them from?

Ultima Online

In 1997 I was just a kid when I was introduced to Sosoria, an online world of dragons, castles, knights and wizards that for now had only existed in books and in my imagination. The excitement and curiosity were unseen. But their was an obstacle that would challenge my DIY skills at the time to the edge. With no internet the fantasy-filled kingdoms were unreachable. A couple of days later I had acquired the necessary knowledge to hook up my PC to the phone (18 meters away) and hack an internet account’s info. Banned from using the computer after 8pm, I would go to sleep early and wake up at midnight. Pull my 20m phone cable from under the bed. Hook it up to the phone near the entrance. Hit the dial up login info. And voila…Britannia!

Ultima Online was the first of its kind. Diablo, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars…all came from seed. The game itself was revealing. Here you were, living in a cosmopolitan concrete jungle, but with a computer and a bit of imagination you could be amongst fields of green where fairies and unicorns existed. The goal of the game was to build your character’s skill base and specialize yourself in certain tactics and trade skills. You could not be MacGuyver. Mage. Blacksmith. Warrior. Thief. Tamer. These were some of your choices. Although you could then hack the idea and develop hybrids, which later on as the game evolved, became the strongest of all. This wasn’t the only thing that evolved.

Every day that passed, the game resembled real life more and more. Except here you did not have to deal with the close-minded individuals in life, but the more perceptive ones. The ones that still oozed creativity. So you began to build relationships with those that you could identify with or that could compliment you. Whether it was your trading guild or your hunting clan, your party always changed. You learned how to interact in different instances, from bargaining a small villa or rare armor to issuing orders in an enemy clan confrontation.

In a good vs evil scenario you could take two paths. Pick up a trade (blacksmithing, mining, alchemy). Gather your gray matter (ore, daisies, dragon’s blood). Create (armor, potions, bows/arrows). Then go to the market place and find a matching buyer, or in other cases rolls inverse, you would be there to buy. This was the good path. A path where you learned how to work a trade, how to hand supply/demand and specially how and where to trade. On the other side, the bad path was taken by the scoundrels.

Those who would hide at crossroads or scout the Silk Road. Then poison or immobilize. Kill the traveller/craftsman. And steal their goods. But here is the catch. Since you could have more than one character per account. Once that player killer knifed your miner to death. You could log in with your axeman and put a hatchet in the murderer’s chest. You learned a system of retribution and of karma that made you always be ready for any circumstance that could present itself.

Guild battles. Rare hunting. Castle building. Item shopping. Exotic pets. In the end all it did was putting a classroom in a Medieval existence. In the end, the one thing that you learned the most was that you had to create yourself in this world and evolve with the circumstances. He who stayed a pure warrior was bound to be killed by those who fenced and casted spells at the same time. And he who stayed tamer was bound to lose out on the white dragons and the wyverns when the bard wizards provoked the area. So you learned the key to this ever-changing world: adaptation.

This centennial post marks a discovery of character through a glimpse at those days of smiles and mischief. When one stops thinking and begins to just be, moments of inspiration surge from the rush of being in a player killing clan and awaiting a band of miners coming from the terrain’s most prolific mine…and out of a sudden the miners appeared with a paladin dozen…but you knew you would emerge victorious.

Stay stagnant. Keep on profession. Be good at one skill. And the world will find a way to cage you. Adapt to change and evolve with the moment and you become innovation.

Ultima Online, the school for those with limitless imagination.
