Ever since we began to delve into the world of giving life, everything turned wrong. You see, it doesn't start with an Independence Day scenario where giant machines arrive from outer space looking to conquer humanity and swallow the remaining of planet Earth's resources. This time it's everything Morpheus promised Neo when he gave him that red pill. A world where artificial intelligence, industrial intelligentia and weaponized platforms are capable of all clicking together to the sound of the same circuit. This is not paranoia or anything similar.

Think about drones. We have been reading news, seeing videos and worst of all, seen in reality, what a little unmanned plane is capable of. Ever since the military world knew that the next big war would not take place with armies or nuclear bombs but with computers. With machines. Hackers and computer scientists have been pushing machines to the edges of imagined usage yet they all know that their are oceans of unclaimed digital horizons that await those who venture. It only takes one machine to have life of its own, recognize the situation in which it exists and create an army out of that which we have already built, except this time, the ones in command are them.

I thought of many documentaries and movies that could illustrate the power of machines and what they could bring upon an over eager user, like the human being. This is the best one I found. I present to you R'ha, the dawn of the Machines.
