Here is an idea I came up with while writing the first chapter of my eBook ADHD Hacking.

For a couple of years now, the idea on every teenager’s dream, young adult’s mind and Social Network watching oldie’s fantasy, has been to create the next online wonder. Startup news to us nowadays have become exactly what CNBC on the plasma became to dot-com buyers in 2000. The Facebooks, Angry Birds and Draw Mes have polluted our minds with one-in-a-million chance ideas centered around concepts that you would honestly recognize as simply dumb. You then try to replicate that perceived simplicity for x amount of time, until the day when you decide that you are not made for this or even worse yet, that it’s a matter of luck.

Let’s look at an example: Instagram. Probably the trendiest app at the moment amongst everyone I know. Was it pure luck what the creators did? You’d think so. I mean how can that simple color filterer be worth $1 billion. But no, it wasn’t luck. The digital app world was rocketing, as it still is, but a trendier, cooler, hipper market was also holding big hype: photography. As a matter of fact, the founders loved to take pictures. Improved cameras, powerful computers and high definition smart phones gave rise to a trend that had last been dominated by telescopic Nikons. How did the Instagram boys do it? They saw a problem. Web 2.0 was in full speed and people were filling their Facebook album folders with thousands of pics they would never look at again. So they created a solution. The missing link. They created a platform that gave people the power of artistic expression through mobile photography. Extremely cool. A picture uploader, a social network to share with and the piece de resistance, two dozen photo filters that turned the amateur clicker into a National Geographic freelancer.

What is the lesson learnt from this small tale of success? Do not copy catapulted pigeons. Instead, solve a problem.

Easy to say, but difficult to do? No. All that is necessary is a higher level of perception. While it is very easy to notice other people’s problems, it is not quite the same thing to identify with them. If you are a male in your late 20s, you are not going to try and invent a new electric wheel chair because all the ones you see in town are too slow? Concentrate on your problems. There are others who will probably have the same issue. Think. What would make your life easier, cooler?

You are a student living in a big city. You spend around 400 euros per month in food. Having shopped at numerous stores, you can associate shops with the price fluctuations of particular products. Carrefour sells a liter of milk 18% more expensive than others. Franprix sells the best price-quality Bordeaux selection. Just like you, there must be a lot of other people that choose which grocery store they step into after cross-referencing price fluctuations per product per store to have a general idea of how much they would save if they shopped strategically knowing that information. You have found your problem.

You are an athlete living in a new metropolis. You have tried to organize football matches with friends, friends of friends and even random people you meet for the first time. But there is always an inconvenience that arises. Having to contact and confirm with each participant. Arranging everyone’s payment in time. Booking the football terrains. Checking the weather. Establishing a car pool network. Just like you, there must be a lot of other groups of friends that have difficulties arranging football matches due to the bureaucratic hassle tied to organizing them. You have found your problem.

What would you need to solve that problem, if there are others that share the same dilemma? You need a trendy solution, a mobile application.

Another easy thing to propose, but quite complicated when the 5 second lightbulb switches off. Why? Because it seems like such a gargantuan task to accomplish. Maybe we can ease into the idea. Let’s de-construct the App. Think analogically as if you were a builder. You cannot construct a house if you envision the finished product. You must find the building blocks that make up that structure. Bricks and cement. That’s all there is to it. Same with an app. We must look at the building blocks. In order to make a successful app we must focus on three areas: development (back-end), design (front-end) and marketing (web 2.0 PR).

Let’s start with the most important part, the backbone. In order to create our grocery index app or our football match booker we will need to learn to program the bare concept in Python to later incorporate it into a web framework with Django. Smart coding entrepreneurs are those who have no homeruns in their record, but instead, several second base hits. Why? Because they launch lean, they launch fast. Amazing ideas thrive on their wielder’s momentum. That makes the development stage your bread and butter. The other two components might make you pretty and popular, but without a solid foundation they are worthless. Nevertheless, the design carries a big weight. Think of the MySpace catastrophe. King of the social networks way before anyone considered any alternatives. It was the only choice. Along came a Harvard geek and made the same thing simpler, prettier, catchier. You get the idea. Whether the choice is CSS or Photoshop, the product’s design will be imperial to its image in the startup world. The last, but not least, component in the trifecta is the marketing. Many of us who decide to embark on app building Odysseys have long before embraced creative expression and become part of the web 2.0 generation. We blog, we tweet, we write eBooks, we dream digital. Therefore, the PR leg of the app’s success is simply the concentration of all your web arsenal in putting your idea, your product, out there. Knowing all this empowers you with a new perspective that should allow you to see a complex issue, de-construct it, understand it and assemble a solution.

So what’s next? Find your problem. Create an app. Share it with the world.
