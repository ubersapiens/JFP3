excerpt: It made me wish it was 7am just to try out a simple version of this yoga flow to wake up every inch from head to toes to a degree of responsive instinct that would allow my anatomy to push me away from that chair when the time was up.

I was looking into various techniques to alleviate the every day back pain that strikes those who sit in their chairs while they wonder into the worlds that their computers hold for them. The business transactions, the programming algorithms, the social media frenzy. It all boils down to the human body being statically prostrated in a permanent squat position which tightens the hamstring muscles, then strikes the gluteus on both sides, to finally crawl up to different regions of our backs. No matter how much of an athlete or how efficient of a worker you are, the pain will find you one day or the other. Just stand up. Walk around. Shift your sedentary labor position.

But sometimes it's not enough. 

And that is when I ran into this inspiring morning video. It made me wish it was 7am just to try out a simple version of this yoga flow to wake up every inch from head to toes to a degree of responsive instinct that would allow my anatomy to push me away from that chair when the time was up.
