As a kid, no matter what your social class is, you see a bicycle as a means to GO. A flying machine that will take you wherever you want.

I remember being very young and going every weekend to a beach far from the city. A beach where not many people frequented, where it was still green and quiet wherever you went. It might sound Tarzanesque, but the ambience sauvage solitaire pushed your imagination, so I climbed trees, I napped on top of hills and I built animal traps. But in all honesty, it was a golden time of ever-lasting freedom and detachment. A time of fun. Nonetheless, I still remained bound to a perimeter. Until I got my first bicycle.

The bicycle changed the way I saw the horizon. I stopped thinking how close I should stay and instead began to ponder how far could I go. There was a ridge that could be seen far away, almost where the sun set. On the other side were other beaches, other people, other ways of thinking…but you also had the best wave break on this side of the country. So every time I could, I would grab those two wheels and go full speed to see the world on that side. It also became a vehicle that enabled trade. From purchasing Cokes at the shop and reselling them for double to gathering mud at the only red soil spot in the area. One made me a pocket fortune while the other fueled another great interest, ceramic sculptures.

Many years later, after a period of confusion, big decisions and a 180 degree turn in life, I decided to grab those two wheels once again and asked myself how far I could go. Surprisingly the answer was still the same after so many years, all I wanted to see was the waves and the beach on the other side. From a cuckoo house in the valley of gnomes through the path of the knights to a place where the pink sun dips into the ocean right before your eyes. So 2000km later, with a clear mind and strong sense of conviction, I arrived in Fisterra or ‘the End of the World’. It was a journey that made me. A bicycle ride beyond the horizon.

There should be no question as to whether the wheel is the ultimate invention of all times, not fire or the iPad.

Like me, many others have also developed a bond with this leg-driven vehicle. Look at Bicycle City:
