The vortex of two continents. The cultural epicenter of the world in the 1500s. The funnel of the psychedelic Silk Road.

Still wondering why Istanbul was the center of the universe at various points in history. Well I will tell you a bit about this incredible 21st century Constantinople.

You start reading facts on the internet about a city that you have seen in several Bond movies and perhaps read about in numerous books, but you never expect to encounter a 15 million horizon-less behemoth like this one. The mosques, the empires, the food. It all passes through your mind while you ride into the city center. The green cat eyes, brown cinnamon skin, bright white smiles of those that marvel at the sight of a new one in town is just delirious. Arrive there at night and don’t think twice before hitting the bar at the Richmond. Your GPS will be off probably, but from the top of this bar you will stare into the Sea of Marmara and the most beautiful view of Istanbul at night.

The bridges connect completely different topographies wherever you cross them. Whether it is the Galata Bridge connecting the sultanesque historical side and the active old townesque side, or the Bosphorus Bridge which connects the palatial shores of Europe to the conglomerated architecture of Asia. But one thing that you can be sure to find in every one of these bridges is fishermen by the dozens. It doesn’t matter what hour of the day it is but sitting with a cup of cay (pronounced chai) tea and holding a fishing rod for no reason but to chill out is a way of being in Byzantium. It’s a hobby. But in all honesty I never saw a fish bigger than my foot in their buckets, so it must not be where the mezze shops get their sea bass.

Topkapi Palace, Hagya Sophia, Blue Mosque, Galata Tower, Hippodrome, Dolmabahce Palace, Grand Bazaar. These are amongst the typical sites in any tour of the Turkish capital, however, mentioning a few other gems seems to have become a habit in these posts so here it goes. The Suleymaniye Mosque is by far the most imposing of all the structures that dominate the 7 hills of the west; not only that but the enormous walls, the magnificent view and the colorful gardens, give it a touch of Elysius when you walk on its grounds. The stadium experiences should be a must in the tour; Fenerbahce vs Galatasarray is the toughest football rivalry in the entire planet, it must be gladiatoric to watch it live. The little streets that descend from Taksim Square towards the Golden Horn are filled with interesting antiques shops, message-transmitting graffiti and a sense of seclusion from the non-stop action in the main route. The spice bazaar is way more intriguing and alluring than the enormous Grand Bazaar, which ends up saturating you in the end if you don’t approach it strategically or in short bursts.

Geographic challenges are usually popular for giving a culturally impacting day or an action packed night. But Istanbul gets a prize for throwing at you infinite quantities of daily amusement and nightly entertainment. Whether it is 360 for trendy drinks and a killer view or the brave path of entering Asmali Miscet. One probably leading to the other, the kaleidoscope of drinks turns into armies of cheap mexican shooters. The entire area is plagued with ever-lasting smiles, bars that scream into the morning, food stands ready to satisfy your first urge and temptation on every turn. An incredible phenomenon can be sensed while walking through these pavilions; the music slides from Persian dances to deep house lounging, creating an atmosphere of historically influenced modernity. There were those who extended their curiosity into the the shores of the Bosphorus and continued their evenings in the hands of Reina, the acknowledged club wonder of the land. And from then on…the rest is forgotten.

However, having talked about day and night, the transition is probably the most incredible thing you can see in this city. About 45 minutes before sunset, climb to the top of Galata Tower. Grab the railing and align yourself with the Suleymaniye mosque. And just sit tight, the spectacle is about to beginning. A degradation from bright yellow, to orange, to purple, to red, to pink. The minarets in the hills. The mist behind the historic peninsula. The sun dives into sea like a ball of fire that dips into a pool of blackness. It is a moment that will print itself into your memories.
