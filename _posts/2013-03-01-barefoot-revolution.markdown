A couple million years ago, if you were walking through a clearing in your Shox and a sabertooth tiger saw you 100 meters away, your lifespan would be that of a shooting star...milliseconds. Hunters, back then, would have never thought of wearing a shoe and if they had anything resembling one, it would be an animal skin or tree bark in order to protect their feet in cold or rugged terrain. Evolution never chose for us to create a device that distanced the sole of our feet from the ground in order to protect the rest of our body from the strains of every day existence.

So what happened?

To make a long, complicated story short, let's cut straight to the problem. Nike, already established as the dominant force in the running shoes market decided to push the innovation envelope into something that attempted to twitch an already perfect machine. Engineers and sports scientists working for this corporate giant had found a way to erase their competition completely, at least until they were able to catch up. They did not build a lighter shoe or a stronger shoe, they built something else.

Does that look like a running shoe or does that look like the prototype model for the first man to walk on Mars? Nike created what is now known as the infamous "heel modification". By arguing that the foot's impact, and directly the knee's impact, would be reduced if some type of shock absorption mechanism was implanted in the back of the shoe. This would allow the new mechanism to absorb the direct push from the ground before the actual heel would even begin to feel it. Of course, back then, I think people were more preoccupied with putting men in the Moon and putting their brains in other planets, so anything that challenged normality seemed worthy of being worn. And that is how the Nike Mania exploded. If you look at a timeline of their best-selling shoes year by year, you will notice a centimetric increase every two or three years. The idea behind the shock absorption and the concept of receiving direct impact through a layer of rubber, foam and plastic stuck to the action of running like if it was a merger conceived since day one.

Decades went by without anyone addressing the consequences of such phenomenon, until the injuries began to appear over and over amongst the same age ranges. Men in their 40s, an age where you are still fit to run at moderate speeds and when endurance becomes your biggest ally, started having injuries that when correlated, all yielded the same epicenters. Article after article told the story of men who had "overrun" their bodies into progressive decomposition. Yet, a couple thousand years back the entire global population was able to chase gazelles and deer for kilometers; guess why. If you could not run, then you could not eat my friend. Evolution could not have turned us from Tarzan to Gepetto so quickly.

I first found out about this physical Armageddon after reading Christopher McDougall's masterpiece, Born to Run. This book tells the story of a man who upon getting severely injured, as a side effect of running too much, decided to seek help. But help was wearing white robes and saw no salvation in poor Chris' state. So he said 'thanks' and went on a quest around the world to search for the ultimate runner. In the end he pieces together an amazing combination of research, story telling and excitement into the most amazing physical performance book I have ever read. But back to the original problem.  As I read this book I became aware of several aspects of my running that were not exactly functioning the way I wanted them too. The breathing, the strides, the speed control. Everything seemed working at 80%. But not more. So what now?

You might believe that legs are the most important building block in the sport of running, but you are far from the truth. It is your core. Your lower back and your abdominal muscles decide whether tomorrow you can go for 20k or for 2k. And that is exactly where my problem began. Every time I would switch back from running shoes to normal, flat, walking shoes, a long walk would turn into two days of lower back pain. But I always thought it was irrelevant as per the shoes. Research led me to excitement which led me to fascination for an idea: switching completely to barefoot. Every sport that I used to do with some type of modified shoe would be done with Vibram built soles and minimalist styles. Running, trekking, weight lifting, bar calisthenics and cycling...barefoot. The first trail treks and the first long runs on asphalt showed me, through painful education, how using heeled running shoes had weakened several muscles in my legs that months later would contribute to a closer to perfect posture.

Although the experiment is a work in progress, the results have been impressive for such short exposure to the change. It takes a bit of adaptation to be able to land on the ball of your food and flexing all the way to the heel. What they call a perfect stride. And the real shock absorption method human infrastructure was equipped with. Improvements to be noted after three months of usage:

a) Lower back pain: Completely gone. The incorporation of an only flat soled shoe line has not only kept me at a standard barefoot ground contact at all times, but also, walking discomforts disappeared.

b) Calves: Growth. Walking barefoot activates muscles and tendons around the tibia that when put into action thicken the muscle region referred to as calves, creating a sort of leg version Popeye.

c) Technique: High awareness and active instinctive reactions. Having the sole of your foot in practically direct contact with the surface you are displacing yourself through creates a higher level of perceptive attention. This relates a bit to what Spiderman used to have, his arachnid sense (in small doses). Holes, sharp objects, animals and obstacles will become more natural as more displacement takes place.

d) Motivation: Highest levels in 27 years. The idea of being able to run barefoot just makes everything fun and exciting. Whether it's riding bicycle from point A to B or sprinting to the next calisthenics playground, motivation rises when that idea is embedded. It becomes a sort of cult behind an idea.

e) Conscience: Polyvalent and flexible. The initial concept of barefoot running, the raving idea that got me into all this world of the alternative, was a mind set. If I mentioned the core was the most influential sports component, barefoot running would lead to yoga which would lead to calisthenics which would lead to who knows what. It is the evolution of human performance, not human technology, which drives us to the next leap.

It was man who turned man weak. The strongest skeletomuscular infrastructure in the animal kingdom and we crumble after our legs hit a certain mileage. Right. I am going to call out bullshit on the entire sports science bureaucratic machine for allowing elevated heels to be incorporated into shoes to compensate for missing the next leap in innovation.

Go BAREFOOT!
