    <p>I have been working for the past two months with an amazing group of people at <span id="focus">BonjourBonjour</span>. The project involves a web and mobile application that facilitates get togethers with people around you. The technology stack we are using is cutting edge, specially on the front end where I have been manipulating <span id="focus">HTML5</span> elements using rich Javascript frameworks, like <span id="focus">BackboneJS</span>.</p>
